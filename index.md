Kveik is a Scandivavian farmhouse yeast that is traditionally dried on a "yeast ring" (gærkrans in Danish) between batches of beer.
For more information, check out [Lars Garshol's blog](http://www.garshol.priv.no/blog/291.html) and the Kveik page on [milkthefunk.com](http://www.milkthefunk.com/wiki/Kveik).
I was inspired by those sites and by the [Medieval Mead and Beer](https://medievalmeadandbeer.wordpress.com/2019/05/04/how-to-make-a-yeast-ring/) blog.

The Danish design for a yeast ring used here is from the book *Landbokvinden* (*Back to the Land*), by Ole Højrup.

# Purchase options
Two versions are available for purchase on [Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/shop/McBoley), with options for maple, oak, or walnut wood:
* [Fully assembled yeast ring](https://www.etsy.com/listing/805408744/scandinavian-yeast-ring)
* [A set of 5 DIY kits for homebrew clubs](https://www.etsy.com/listing/806043770/club-kit-diy-5-scandinavian-yeast-rings) <br/>(may require some additional cutting and/or sanding)

# Open source
You can use the source files to make your own ring:
* [ring element](//github.com/JonBoley/kveik-ring/blob/master/ring_element.svg) - most pieces will look like this<br/>![ring_element]
* [ring key](//github.com/JonBoley/kveik-ring/blob/master/ring_key.svg)<br/>![ring_key]

(Note that this design is intended for wood that is 3.2 mm (1/8 in) thick. You will need to make adjustments for other thicknesses.)

# Manufacturing
* I cut my first one by hand, but you can also use these files for laser-cutting these pieces.
* I recommend [ponoko.com](https://ponoko.com) because it's a great service, and they offer a choice of hardwood materials.

# Assembly
  * *do not* discard scrap pieces until you are done.
  * if ordering from a laser-cutting service, there will likely be stickers on both sides. Be sure to remove both.
  * there is a key piece that only has two 'teeth'. This will be the first piece in the assembly, and we will use a scrap piece to hold the two ends of the chain together.
  * there is often some variability in the thickness of wood, so assembly may require some sanding. I recommend very fine sandpaper (>200 grit). If the wood sheet is too thin, you might even have to cut your own piece to tightly lock the key in place.

Kveik is a Scandivavian farmhouse yeast that is traditionally dried on a "yeast ring" (g√¶rkrans in Danish) between batches of beer.
For more information, check out http://www.milkthefunk.com/wiki/Kveik

I was inspired by that site and by https://medievalmeadandbeer.wordpress.com/2019/05/04/how-to-make-a-yeast-ring/

This specific design is from a Danish yeast ring in the book Landbokvinden (Back to the land, 1964).

You can use the files here to make your own. Alternatively, two versions are available for purchase online
* [Fully assembled yeast ring](https://www.etsy.com/listing/805408744/scandinavian-yeast-ring) (your choice of maple, oak, or walnut wood)
* [A set of 5 DIY kits for homebrew clubs](https://www.etsy.com/listing/806043770/club-kit-diy-5-scandinavian-yeast-rings) (may require some additional cutting and/or sanding)

Notes:
* most pieces look like the one in `ring_element.svg`
* `ring_elements_104.svg` contains 104 pieces. I prefer a tight untwisted ring with 93 pieces, but you can use more or less pieces and/or twisting.
* this design is intended for wood that is 1/8 inch thick. You will need to make adjustments for other thicknesses.
* there is a key piece in one corner (the one that only has two 'teeth')

Manufacturing:
* I cut my first one by hand, but you can also use these files for laser-cutting these pieces.
* I recommend https://ponoko.com because it's a great service, and they offer maple, oak, and walnut hardwoods.
* most lines should be cut, but I also added my own branding to etch the key piece

Assembly:
  * *do not* discard scrap pieces until you are done.
  * if ordering from a laser-cutting service, there will likely be stickers on both sides. Be sure to remove both.
  * there is a key piece that only has two 'teeth'. This will be the first piece in the assembly, and we will use a scrap piece to hold the two ends of the chain together.
  * there is often some variability in the thickness of wood, so assembly may require some sanding. (I recommend very fine sandpaper like 220 grit.) You might even have to cut your own piece to lock the key in place.
